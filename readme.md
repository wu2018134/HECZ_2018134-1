# Utilization of moss for power generation

I get this idea from[the United Nations sustainable development goals NO.7.](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/energy/)This is a project of using moss to provide clean energy for citizens.

# MY DREAMS
Let people use afforable and clean energy.

# SOME PROBLEMS
How can we produce more energy with the same size of moss?
How can we collect the energy?

# SOMETHING I ALREADY KNOW
People can use other sustainable development ways to provide energy

# SOMETHING I WANT TO KNOW
How much I can build this in the city?
